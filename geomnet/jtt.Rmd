jtt Number of JTTs in a graph

#### Description

Number of jumping transitive triplets (JTT) in a graph. A JTT between three nodes i,j, and k is defined as the situation that when there is a (directed) edge from i to j and an edge from j to k there is also a direct edge from i to k. In an undirected situation we can think of any undirected edge as two directed edges between the two nodes involved.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
jtt(data, from_id, to_id)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* ``data``: data set
* ``from_id``: name of the variable of edge tails
* ``to_id``: name of the variable of edge heads

#### Examples
```{r}
data(blood)
ggplot(data= blood$edges) + geom_net(aes(from_id=from, to_id=to), directed=TRUE) + theme_net()
jtt(blood$edges, "from", "to")
# this number is very high compared to the overall number of edges that are not self-loops
nrow(subset(blood$edges, from != to))
```
