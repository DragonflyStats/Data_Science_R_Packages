``theme_net`` Theme for network visualization

#### Description

Themes set the general aspect of the plot such as the colour of the background, gridlines, the size and colour of fonts. theme_net provides access to the regular ggplot2 theme, but removes any
background, axes, and ensures an aspect ratio of 1 for better viewing of networks and graphs.

#### Arguments
* ``base_size``: base font size
* ``base_family``: base font family

#### Examples
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(blood)
p <- ggplot(data = blood$edges, aes(from_id = from, to_id = to))
p + geom_net()
p + geom_net() + theme_net()
```
