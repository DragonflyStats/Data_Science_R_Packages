protein A protein interaction network (undirected)
#### Description
A list of two datasets, vertices and edges, containing data on the complete protein-protein interaction
network in the yeast species S. cerevisiae (http://www3.nd.edu/~networks/resources.htm).
The variables are as follows:
Usage
protein
Format
A list of two data frames:
• the edges data set consists of two variables of length 4480:
– from, to: Integer variables describing interactions between proteins, which are identified
integers
• the vertices vector consists of the corresponding IDs of 2113 proteins in the edges data set
