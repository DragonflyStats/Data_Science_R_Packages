## ``lesmis ``

Coappearance network of characters in Les Miserables (undirected)



#### Description

A list of two datasets, vertices and edges, containing data on characters and their coapperance in chapters in Victor Hugo’s Les Miserables. The variables are as follows:

#### Usage
lesmis

#### Format
A list of two data frames:
• the edges data set consists of three variables of length 254:
– from: Character 1
– to: Character 2
– degree: number of times they appear together in a chapter of Les Miserables
• the vertices data set consists of two variables with information on 77 characters:
– id: Character ID number
– label: Character name

#### Examples
```{r}
# prep the data
lesmisnet <- merge(lesmis$edges, lesmis$vertices, by.x = "from",
by.y = "label", all = TRUE)
lesmisnet$degree[is.na(lesmisnet$degree)] <- 0
# create plot
library(geomnet)
library(dplyr)
ggplot(data = lesmisnet, aes(from_id = from, to_id = to,
linewidth = degree / 5 + 0.1 )) +
geom_net(aes(size = degree, alpha = degree),
colour = "grey30", ecolour = "grey60",
layout.alg = "fruchtermanreingold", labelon = TRUE, vjust = -0.75) +
scale_alpha(range = c(0.3, 1)) +
theme_net()
