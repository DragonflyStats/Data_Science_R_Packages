## ``GeomCircle ``

Geom for drawing circles in the ggplot2 framework

#### Description
Circles are drawn with a specified radius centered at (x, y). This geom is very much exploratory - we are using it for drawing edges for self #### References. It is not explored for any more general use, so use with caution!

#### Usage
<pre><code>
GeomCircle
geom_circle(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "identity",
position = "identity", na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA,
inherit.aes = TRUE, radius = 0.05, ...)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* ``mapping``: Set of aesthetic mappings created by aes or aes_. If specified and inherit.aes = TRUE
(the default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the plot.
You must supply mapping if there is no plot mapping.
* ``data``: The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three options:
If NULL, the default, the data is inherited from the plot data as specified in the call to ggplot.
A data.frame, or other object, will override the plot data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See fortify for which variables will be created. A function will be called with a single argument, the plot data. The return value must be a data.frame., and will be used as the layer data.
* ``stat``: The statistical transformation to use on the data for this layer, as a string.
* ``position``: Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of a call to a position adjustment function.
* na.rm If FALSE, the default, missing values are removed with a warning. If TRUE, missing values are silently removed.
* ``show.legend``: logical. Should this layer be included in the legends? NA, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped. FALSE never includes, and TRUE always includes.
* inherit.aes If FALSE, overrides the default aesthetics, rather than combining with them.
This is most useful for helper functions that define both data and aesthetics and shouldnâ€™t inherit behaviour from the default plot specification, e.g. borders.
* ``radius``: numeric value giving the radius of the circle to be drawn (0-1 normalized scale)
... other arguments passed on to layer. These are often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like color = "red" or size = 3. They may also be
parameters to the paired geom/stat.

#### Format
An object of class GeomCircle (inherits from Geom, ggproto) of length 5.

#### Examples

```{r}
# circles are drawn centered at x and y
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_circle(radius=0.1) + geom_point()
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_circle(linetype=2, radius=0.05, alpha=0.5)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_circle(aes(linetype=factor(cyl)), radius=0.05, alpha=0.5)
geom_net 11
```
