### Scope

Machine Learning - types of analysis

#### Many Types of ML Problems
* Clustering 
* Classification
* Regression


#### Focus on Regression

* Predicting a numeric value based on predictors
* Can easily generalize most of the content to all Linear Models (ANOVA)
---


### Scope
 - Mainly focusing on item-wise diagnostics 


#### Feature Engineering

Not Covering This - but it is important

* Normalisation
* Scaling
* One-hot Encoding / Model Matrices
* Log Transformation
* Box-Cox Transformation


* {caret} package

---

### {yardstick}
(**Digression**)

Not Really Covering Machine Learning or Binary Classifers
 
* Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-Score
* NPV, PPV
* Lift and Gain Curves

Includes a lot of functionality for standard regression model metrics
