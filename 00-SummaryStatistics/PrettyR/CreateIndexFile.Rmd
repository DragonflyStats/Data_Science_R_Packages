Write an index file for the current output (htmlize).
#### Description
Write an index file for the current HTML output.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
CreateIndexFile(HTMLbase,HTMLdir,title="R listing")
</code></pre>

#### Arguments 
* HTMLbase The base name for the HTML files.
* HTMLdir The directory in which to write the HTML files.
* title The title for the listing.

#### Details
‘CreateIndexFile’ opens a new HTML index file. If there is another file with the same name, it will be overwritten. This is intentional, as the user may want to run ‘htmlize’ repeatedly without generating multiple sets of files. It then writes the frameset definition into the file and closes it.

#### Value
nil
