Find the modal value, i.e. most commonly occuring

#### Description
Finds the modal value of an object (usually a factor).

#### Usage
<pre><code>
Mode(x,na.rm=FALSE)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments 
* ``x``: An object, usually a factor.
* ``na.rm``: A dummy argument to make it compatible with calls to ‘mean’, etc.

#### Details
‘Mode’ finds the modal value of the object. If there are multiple modal values, it returns an appropriate message. If ‘Mode’ is called with a continuous variable, it will not in general return a sensible answer. It does not attempt to estimate the density of the values and return an approximate modal value.

#### Value
The modal value of the object as a character string.

#### Note
This is not the same as ‘mode’ that determines the data mode of an object.
