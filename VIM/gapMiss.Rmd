Missing value gap statistics

#### Description 

Computes the average missing value gap of a vector.

#### Usage 
<pre><code>
gapMiss(x, what = mean)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* ``x``: a numeric vector
* ``what``: default is the arithmetic mean. One can include an own function that returns a vector of lenght 1 (e.g. median)

#### Examples 
```{r}
v <- rnorm(20)
v[3] <- NA
v[6:9] <- NA
v[13:17] <- NA
v
gapMiss(v)
gapMiss(v, what = median)
gapMiss(v, what = function(x) mean(x, trim = 0.1))
gapMiss(v, what = var)growdotMiss
```

#### Details 

The length of each sequence of missing values (gap) in a vector is calculated and the mean gap is
reported
