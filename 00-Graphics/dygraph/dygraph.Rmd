dygraph dygraph interactive plot for time series data

#### Description

R interface to interactive time series plotting using the dygraphs JavaScript library.

#### Usage

<pre><code>
dygraph(data, main = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL, periodicity = NULL, group = NULL, elementId = NULL, width = NULL, height = NULL)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments

* data Either time series data or numeric data. For time series, this must be an xts
* object or an object which is convertible to xts. For numeric data, this must be a named list or data frame, where the first element/column provides x-axis values and all subsequent elements/columns provide one or more series of y-values.
* main Main plot title (optional)
* xlab X axis label
* ylab Y axis label
* periodicity Periodicity of time series data (automatically detected via xts::periodicity if not specified).
* group Group to associate this plot with. The x-axis zoom level of plots within a group is automatically synchronized.
elementId Use an explicit element ID for the widget (rather than an automatically generated one). Useful if you have other JavaScript that needs to explicitly discover and interact with a specific widget instance.
* width Width in pixels (optional, defaults to automatic sizing)
* height Height in pixels (optional, defaults to automatic sizing)

#### Value
