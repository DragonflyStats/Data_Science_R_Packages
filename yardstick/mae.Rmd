title: "``yardstick::mae`` - Mean absolute error"
output: html_document
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(yardstick)
```




#### Description

Calculate the mean absolute error. This metric is in the same units as the original data.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
mae(data, ...)
## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
mae(data, truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, ...)
mae_vec(truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments

* ``data`` A data.frame containing the truth and estimate columns.
* ``...`` Not currently used.
* ``truth`` The column identifier for the true results (that is numeric). This should be an
* ``unquoted`` column name although this argument is passed by expression and supports quasiquotation (you can unquote column names). For ``_vec()`` functions, a numeric vector.
* ``estimate`` The column identifier for the predicted results (that is also numeric). As with truth this can be specified different ways but the primary method is to use an unquoted variable name. For ``_vec()`` functions, a numeric vector.
* ``na_rm`` A logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the computation proceeds.


#### Examples
```{r}
# Supply truth and predictions as bare column names
mae(solubility_test, solubility, prediction)
library(dplyr)
set.seed(1234)
size <- 100
times <- 10
# create 10 resamples
solubility_resampled <- bind_rows(
   replicate(
      n = times,
      expr = sample_n(solubility_test, size, replace = TRUE),
      simplify = FALSE
      ),
   .id = "resample"
   )

```

```{r}
# Compute the metric by group
metric_results <- solubility_resampled %>%
  group_by(resample) %>%
  mae(solubility, prediction)

metric_results

# Resampled mean estimate
metric_results %>%
  summarise(avg_estimate = mean(.estimate))
```

#### Value
A tibble with columns .metric, .estimator, and .estimate and 1 row of values.
For grouped data frames, the number of rows returned will be the same as the number of groups.
For ``mae_vec()``, a single numeric value (or NA).
