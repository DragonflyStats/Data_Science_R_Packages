## ``rpd``: Ratio of performance to deviation

#### Description

These functions are appropriate for cases where the model outcome is a numeric. The ratio of performance to deviation (``rpd()``) and the ratio of performance to inter-quartile (``rpiq()``) are both measures of consistency/correlation between observed and predicted values (and not of accuracy).

#### Usage

<pre><code>
rpd(data, ...)
## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
rpd(data, truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, ...)
rpd_vec(truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments

*``	data	``:	A data.frame containing the truth and estimate columns.
*``	...	``:	Not currently used.
*``	truth	``:	The column identifier for the true results (that is numeric). This should be an
			unquoted column name although this argument is passed by expression and sup-
			ports quasiquotation (you can unquote column names). For ``_vec()`` functions, a
			numeric vector.
*``	estimate	``:	The column identifier for the predicted results (that is also numeric). As with
			truth, this can be specified different ways but the primary method is to use an
			unquoted variable name. For ``_vec()`` functions, a numeric vector.
*``	na_rm	``:	A logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the
			computation proceeds.


#### Examples
```{r}
# Supply truth and predictions as bare column names
rpd(solubility_test, solubility, prediction)
library(dplyr)
set.seed(1234)
size <- 100
times <- 10
```


```{r}
# create 10 resamples
solubility_resampled <- bind_rows(
replicate(
n = times,
expr = sample_n(solubility_test, size, replace = TRUE),
simplify = FALSE
),
.id = "resample"
)
```


```{r}
# Compute the metric by group
metric_results <- solubility_resampled %>%
group_by(resample) %>%
rpd(solubility, prediction)
metric_results
```


```{r}
# Resampled mean estimate
metric_results %>%
summarise(avg_estimate = mean(.estimate))
```

#### Details
In the field of spectroscopy in particular, the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) has been used as the standard way to report the quality of a model. It is the ratio between the standard deviation of a variable and the standard error of prediction of that variable by a given model. However, its systematic use has been criticized by several authors, since using the standard deviation to represent the spread of a variable can be misleading on skewed dataset. The ratio of performance to interquartile has been introduced by Bellon-Maurel et al. (2010) to address some of these issues, and generalise the RPD to non-normally distributed variables.

#### Value
A tibble with columns .metric, .estimator, and .estimate and 1 row of values.
For grouped data frames, the number of rows returned will be the same as the number of groups.
For ``rpd_vec()``, a single numeric value (or NA).
