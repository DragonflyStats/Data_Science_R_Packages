Negative predictive value

#### Description

These functions calculate the ``npv()`` (negative predictive value) of a measurement system compared to a reference result (the "truth" or gold standard). Highly related functions are ``spec()``, ``sens()``, and ``ppv()``.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
npv(data, ...)
## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
npv(data, truth, estimate, prevalence = NULL,
estimator = NULL, na_rm = TRUE, ...)
npv_vec(truth, estimate, prevalence = NULL, estimator = NULL,
na_rm = TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments

* ``data``: Either a data.frame containing the truth and estimate columns, or a table/matrix where the true class results should be in the columns of the table.
* ``...``: Not currently used.
* ``truth``: The column identifier for the true class results (that is a factor). This should be an unquoted column name although this argument is passed by expression and supports quasiquotation (you can unquote column names). For ``_vec()`` functions, a factor vector.
* ``estimate``: The column identifier for the predicted class results (that is also factor). As with truth this can be specified different ways but the primary method is to use an unquoted variable name. For ``_vec()`` functions, a factor vector.
* ``prevalence``: A numeric value for the rate of the "positive" class of the data. 
* ``estimator``: One of: "binary", "macro", "macro_weighted", or "micro" to specify the type of averaging to be done. "binary" is only relevant for the two class case. The other three are general methods for calculating multiclass metrics. The default will automatically choose "binary" or "macro" based on estimate.
* ``na_rm``: A logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the
computation proceeds.



#### Examples
```{r}
# Two class
data("two_class_example")
npv(two_class_example, truth, predicted)
```

```{r}
# Multiclass
library(dplyr)
data(hpc_cv)
hpc_cv %>%
filter(Resample == "Fold01") %>%
npv(obs, pred)
```

```{r}
# Groups are respected
hpc_cv %>%
group_by(Resample) %>%
npv(obs, pred)
```

```{r}
# Weighted macro averaging
hpc_cv %>%
group_by(Resample) %>%
npv(obs, pred, estimator = "macro_weighted")
```

```{r}
# Vector version
npv_vec(two_class_example$truth, two_class_example$predicted)
# Making Class2 the "relevant" level
options(yardstick.event_first = FALSE)
npv_vec(two_class_example$truth, two_class_example$predicted)
options(yardstick.event_first = TRUE)
```
#### Details
The positive predictive value (``ppv()``) is defined as the percent of predicted positives that are actually
positive while the negative predictive value (``npv()``) is defined as the percent of negative positives
that are actually negative.

#### Value
A tibble with columns .metric, .estimator, and .estimate and 1 row of values.
For grouped data frames, the number of rows returned will be the same as the number of groups.
For npv_vec(), a single numeric value (or NA).

#### Relevant level
There is no common convention on which factor level should automatically be considered the
"event" or "positive" result. In yardstick, the default is to use the first level. To change this, a
global option called yardstick.event_first is set to TRUE when the package is loaded. This can
be changed to FALSE if the last level of the factor is considered the level of interest. For multiclass
extensions involving one-vs-all comparisons (such as macro averaging), this option is ignored and
the "one" level is always the relevant result.
Multiclass
Macro, micro, and macro-weighted averaging is available for this metric. The default is to select
macro averaging if a truth factor with more than 2 levels is provided. Otherwise, a standard binary
calculation is done. See vignette("multiclass", "yardstick") for more information.

#### Implementation
Suppose a 2x2 table with notation:
Predicted
Positive
Negative
Reference
Positive
A
C
Negative
B
D
The formulas used here are:
Sensitivity = A/(A + C)
Specif icity = D/(B + D)
P revalence = (A + C)/(A + B + C + D)
P P V = (Sensitivity???P revalence)/((Sensitivity???P revalence)+((1???Specif icity)???(1???P revalence)))
N P V = (Specif icity???(1???P revalence))/(((1???Sensitivity)???P revalence)+((Specif icity)???(1???P revalence)))
