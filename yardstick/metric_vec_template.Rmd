metric_vec_template
Developer function for calling new metrics

#### Description

metric_vec_template() is useful alongside metric_summarizer() for implementing new cus-
tom metrics. metric_summarizer() calls the metric function inside dplyr::summarise(). metric_vec_template()
is a generalized function that calls the core implementation of a metric function, and includes a
number of checks on the types, lengths, and argument inputs.

#### Usage

metric_vec_template(metric_impl, truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE,
cls = "numeric", estimator = NULL, ...)46
mn_log_loss

#### Arguments

metric_impl The core implementation function of your custom metric. This core implemen-
tation function is generally defined inside the vector method of your metric func-
tion.
truth The realized vector of truth. This is either a factor or a numeric.
estimate The realized estimate result. This is either a numeric vector, a factor vector, or
a numeric matrix (in the case of multiple class probability columns) depending
on your metric function.
na_rm A logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the
computation proceeds. NA values are removed before getting to your core im-
plementation function so you do not have to worry about handling them yourself.
If na_rm=FALSE and any NA values exist, then NA is automatically returned.
cls A character vector of length 1 or 2 corresponding to the class that truth and
estimate should be, respectively. If truth and estimate are of the same class,
just supply a vector of length 1. If they are different, supply a vector of length
2. For matrices, it is best to supply "numeric" as the class to check here.
estimator The type of averaging to use. By this point, the averaging type should be
finalized, so this should be a character vector of length 1. By default, this
character value is required to be one of: "binary", "macro", "micro", or
"macro_weighted". If your metric allows more or less averaging methods,
override this with averaging_override.
... Extra arguments to your core metric function, metric_impl, can technically be
passed here, but generally the extra args are added through Râ€™s scoping rules
because the core metric function is created on the fly when the vector method is
called.
Details
metric_vec_template() is called from the vector implementation of your metric. Also defined
inside your vector implementation is a separate function performing the core implementation of the
metric function. This core function is passed along to metric_vec_template() as metric_impl.
