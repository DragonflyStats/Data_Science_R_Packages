rmse
Root mean squared error

#### Description

Calculate the root mean squared error. rmse() is a metric that is in the same units as the original
data.

#### Usage

<pre><code>
rmse(data, ...)
## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
rmse(data, truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, ...)
rmse_vec(truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments

* data A data.frame containing the truth and estimate columns.
* ... Not currently used.
* truth The column identifier for the true results (that is numeric). This should be an unquoted column name although this argument is passed by expression and sup-
ports quasiquotation (you can unquote column names). For _vec() functions, a numeric vector.
estimate The column identifier for the predicted results (that is also numeric). As with
truth this can be specified different ways but the primary method is to use an
unquoted variable name. For _vec() functions, a numeric vector.
na_rm A logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the
computation proceeds.
Value
A tibble with columns .metric, .estimator, and .estimate and 1 row of values.
For grouped data frames, the number of rows returned will be the same as the number of groups.
For rmse_vec(), a single numeric value (or NA).

#### Examples
```{r}
# Supply truth and predictions as bare column names
rmse(solubility_test, solubility, prediction)
library(dplyr)
set.seed(1234)
size <- 100
times <- 10
# create 10 resamples
solubility_resampled <- bind_rows(
replicate(
n = times,
expr = sample_n(solubility_test, size, replace = TRUE),
simplify = FALSE
),
.id = "resample"
)
# Compute the metric by group
metric_results <- solubility_resampled %>%
group_by(resample) %>%
rmse(solubility, prediction)
metric_results
# Resampled mean estimate
metric_results %>%
summarise(avg_estimate = mean(.estimate))
```
