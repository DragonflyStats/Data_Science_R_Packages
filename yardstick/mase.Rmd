mase
Mean absolute scaled error

#### Description

Calculate the mean absolute scaled error. This metric is scale independent and symmetric. It is
generally used for comparing forecast error in time series settings. Due to the time series nature of
this metric, it is neccesary to order observations in ascending order by time.

#### Usage

<pre><code>
mase(data, ...)
## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
mase(data, truth, estimate, m = 1L,
mae_train = NULL, na_rm = TRUE, ...)
mase_vec(truth, estimate, m = 1L, mae_train = NULL, na_rm = TRUE,
...)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments

data A data.frame containing the truth and estimate columns.
... Not currently used.
truth The column identifier for the true results (that is numeric). This should be an
unquoted column name although this argument is passed by expression and sup-
ports quasiquotation (you can unquote column names). For _vec() functions, a
numeric vector.
estimate The column identifier for the predicted results (that is also numeric). As with
truth this can be specified different ways but the primary method is to use an
unquoted variable name. For _vec() functions, a numeric vector.
m An integer value of the number of lags used to calculate the in-sample seasonal
naive error. The default is used for non-seasonal time series. If each observation
was at the daily level and the data showed weekly seasonality, then m = 7L
would be a reasonable choice for a 7-day seasonal naive calculation.
mae_train A numeric value which allows the user to provide the in-sample seasonal naive
mean absolute error. If this value is not provided, then the out-of-sample sea-
sonal naive mean absolute error will be calculated from truth and will be used
instead.38
mase
na_rm
A logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the
computation proceeds.
Details
mase() is different from most numeric metrics. The original implementation of mase() calls for
using the in-sample naive mean absolute error to compute scaled errors with. It uses this instead
of the out-of-sample error because there is a chance that the out-of-sample error cannot be com-
puted when forecasting a very short horizon (i.e. the out of sample size is only 1 or 2). However,
yardstick only knows about the out-of-sample truth and estimate values. Because of this, the
out-of-sample error is used in the computation by default. If the in-sample naive mean absolute er-
ror is required and known, it can be passed through in the mae_train argument and it will be used
instead. If the in-sample data is available, the naive mean absolute error can easily be computed
with mae(data, truth, lagged_truth).
Value
A tibble with columns .metric, .estimator, and .estimate and 1 row of values.
For grouped data frames, the number of rows returned will be the same as the number of groups.
For mase_vec(), a single numeric value (or NA).
