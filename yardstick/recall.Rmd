## ``recall``: Recall

#### Description

These functions calculate the ``recall()`` of a measurement system for finding relevant documents compared to reference results (the truth regarding relevance). 
Highly related functions are ``precision()`` and ``f_meas()``.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
recall(data, ...)
## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
recall(data, truth, estimate, estimator = NULL,
na_rm = TRUE, ...)
recall_vec(truth, estimate, estimator = NULL, na_rm = TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments

* ``data``: Either a data.frame containing the truth and estimate columns, or a table/matrix
where the true class results should be in the columns of the table.
* ``...``: Not currently used.
* ``truth`` The column identifier for the true class results (that is a factor). This should be an unquoted column name although this argument is passed by expression and supports quasiquotation (you can unquote column names). For ``_vec()``: functions, a factor vector.
* estimate The column identifier for the predicted class results (that is also factor). As with truth this can be specified different ways but the primary method is to use an unquoted variable name. For ``_vec()`` functions, a factor vector.

* ``estimator``: One of: "binary", "macro", "macro_weighted", or "micro" to specify the type of averaging to be done. "binary" is only relevant for the two class case.
The other three are general methods for calculating multiclass metrics. The default will automatically choose "binary" or "macro" based on estimate.
* ``na_rm``: A logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the computation proceeds.


#### Examples
```{r}
# Two class
data("two_class_example")
recall(two_class_example, truth, predicted)
```

```{r}
# Multiclass
library(dplyr)
data(hpc_cv)
hpc_cv %>%
filter(Resample == "Fold01") %>%
recall(obs, pred)
```

```{r}
# Groups are respected
hpc_cv %>%
group_by(Resample) %>%
recall(obs, pred)
```

```{r}
# Weighted macro averaging
hpc_cv %>%
group_by(Resample) %>%
recall(obs, pred, estimator = "macro_weighted")
```

```{r}
# Vector version
recall_vec(two_class_example$truth, two_class_example$predicted)
# Making Class2 the "relevant" level
options(yardstick.event_first = FALSE)
recall_vec(two_class_example$truth, two_class_example$predicted)
options(yardstick.event_first = TRUE)
```

#### Details
The recall (aka sensitivity) is defined as the proportion of relevant results out of the number of samples which were actually relevant. When there are no relevant results, recall is not defined and a value of NA is returned.

#### Value
A tibble with columns ``.metric``, ``.estimator``, and ``.estimate`` and 1 row of values.
For grouped data frames, the number of rows returned will be the same as the number of groups.
For ``recall_vec()``, a single numeric value (or NA).

#### Relevant level
There is no common convention on which factor level should automatically be considered the "event" or "positive" result. In yardstick, the default is to use the first level. To change this, a global option called yardstick.event_first is set to TRUE when the package is loaded. This can be changed to FALSE if the last level of the factor is considered the level of interest. For multiclass extensions involving one-vs-all comparisons (such as macro averaging), this option is ignored and the "one" level is always the relevant result.

#### Multiclass
Macro, micro, and macro-weighted averaging is available for this metric. The default is to select macro averaging if a truth factor with more than 2 levels is provided. Otherwise, a standard binary calculation is done. See vignette("multiclass", "yardstick") for more information.

#### Implementation
Suppose a 2x2 table with notation:
Predicted
Relevant
Irrelevant
Reference
Relevant
A
C
Irrelevant
B
D
The formulas used here are:
recall = A/(A + C)
precision = A/(A + B)64
recall
F m eas ?? = (1 + ?? 2 ) ??? precision ??? recall/((?? 2 ??? precision) + recall)
See the references for discussions of the statistics.
