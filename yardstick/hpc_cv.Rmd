Class Probability Predictions

#### Description

Class Probability Predictions
Details
This data frame contains the predicted classes and class probabilities for a linear discriminant analy-
sis model fit to the HPC data set from Kuhn and Johnson (2013). These data are the assessment sets
from a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. The data column columns for the true class (obs), the class
prediction (pred) and columns for each class probability (columns VF, F, M, and L). Additionally, a
column for the resample indicator is included.
