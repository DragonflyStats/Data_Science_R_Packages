mn_log_loss
Mean log loss

#### Description

Compute the logarithmic loss of a classification model.mn_log_loss
47

#### Usage

mn_log_loss(data, ...)
## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
mn_log_loss(data, truth, ..., na_rm = TRUE,
sum = FALSE)
mn_log_loss_vec(truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, sum = FALSE, ...)

#### Arguments

data A data.frame containing the truth and estimate columns.
... A set of unquoted column names or one or more dplyr selector functions to
choose which variables contain the class probabilities. If truth is binary, only
1 column should be selected. Otherwise, there should be as many columns as
factor levels of truth.
truth The column identifier for the true class results (that is a factor). This should be
an unquoted column name although this argument is passed by expression and
supports quasiquotation (you can unquote column names). For _vec() func-
tions, a factor vector.
na_rm A logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the
computation proceeds.
sum A logical. Should the sum of the likelihood contributions be returned (instead
of the mean value)?
estimate If truth is binary, a numeric vector of class probabilities corresponding to the
"relevant" class. Otherwise, a matrix with as many columns as factor levels of
truth. It is assumed that these are in the same order as the levels of truth.
Details
Log loss is a measure of the performance of a classification model. A perfect model has a log loss
of 0.
Compared with accuracy(), log loss takes into account the uncertainty in the prediction and gives
a more detailed view into the actual performance. For example, given two input probabilities of
.6 and .9 where both are classified as predicting a positive value, say, "Yes", the accuracy metric
would interpret them as having the same value. If the true output is "Yes", log loss penalizes .6
because it is "less sure" of itâ€™s result compared to the probability of .9.
Value
A tibble with columns .metric, .estimator, and .estimate and 1 row of values.
For grouped data frames, the number of rows returned will be the same as the number of groups.
For mn_log_loss_vec(), a single numeric value (or NA).48

Multiclass
Log loss has a known multiclass extension, and is simply the sum of the log loss values for each
class prediction. Because of this, no averaging types are supported.

#### Examples
```{r}
# Two class
data("two_class_example")
mn_log_loss(two_class_example, truth, Class1)
# Multiclass
library(dplyr)
data(hpc_cv)
# You can use the col1:colN tidyselect syntax
hpc_cv %>%
filter(Resample == "Fold01") %>%
mn_log_loss(obs, VF:L)
# Groups are respected
hpc_cv %>%
group_by(Resample) %>%
mn_log_loss(obs, VF:L)
# Vector version
# Supply a matrix of class probabilities
fold1 <- hpc_cv %>%
filter(Resample == "Fold01")
mn_log_loss_vec(
truth = fold1$obs,
matrix(
c(fold1$VF, fold1$F, fold1$M, fold1$L),
ncol = 4
)
)
# Supply `...` with quasiquotation
prob_cols <- levels(two_class_example$truth)
mn_log_loss(two_class_example, truth, Class1)
mn_log_loss(two_class_example, truth, !! prob_cols[1])npv
