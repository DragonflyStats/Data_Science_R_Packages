Matthews correlation coefficient

#### Description

Matthews correlation coefficient

#### Usage

<pre><code>
mcc(data, ...)
## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
mcc(data, truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, ...)
mcc_vec(truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments

* ``data``: Either a data.frame containing the truth and estimate columns, or a table/matrix where the true class results should be in the columns of the table.
* ``...``: Not currently used.
* ``truth``: The column identifier for the true class results (that is a factor). This should be an unquoted column name although this argument is passed by expression and
supports quasiquotation (you can unquote column names). For ``_vec()`` functions, a factor vector.
* ``estimate``: The column identifier for the predicted class results (that is also factor). As
with truth this can be specified different ways but the primary method is to use an unquoted variable name. For ``_vec()`` functions, a factor vector.
* ``na_rm``: A logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the computation proceeds.



#### Examples

```{r}
# Two class
data("two_class_example")
mcc(two_class_example, truth, predicted)
# Multiclass
# mcc() has a natural multiclass extension
library(dplyr)
data(hpc_cv)
hpc_cv %>%
group_by(Resample) %>%
mcc(obs, pred)metrics
```


## Value
A tibble with columns .metric, .estimator, and .estimate and 1 row of values.
For grouped data frames, the number of rows returned will be the same as the number of groups.
For mcc_vec(), a single numeric value (or NA).

#### Relevant level
There is no common convention on which factor level should automatically be considered the
"event" or "positive" result. In yardstick, the default is to use the first level. To change this, a
global option called yardstick.event_first is set to TRUE when the package is loaded. This can
be changed to FALSE if the last level of the factor is considered the level of interest. For multiclass
extensions involving one-vs-all comparisons (such as macro averaging), this option is ignored and
the "one" level is always the relevant result.
Multiclass
mcc() has a known multiclass generalization and that is computed automatically if a factor with
more than 2 levels is provided. Because of this, no averaging methods are provided.
