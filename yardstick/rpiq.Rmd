Ratio of performance to inter-quartile

#### Description

These functions are appropriate for cases where the model outcome is a numeric. The ratio of
performance to deviation (rpd()) and the ratio of performance to inter-quartile (rpiq()) are both
measures of consistency/correlation between observed and predicted values (and not of accuracy).

#### Usage
<pre><code>
rpiq(data, ...)
## S3 method for class 'data.frame'
rpiq(data, truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, ...)
rpiq_vec(truth, estimate, na_rm = TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>

#### Arguments

data
...
truth
estimate
na_rm
A data.frame containing the truth and estimate columns.
Not currently used.
The column identifier for the true results (that is numeric). This should be an
unquoted column name although this argument is passed by expression and sup-
ports quasiquotation (you can unquote column names). For _vec() functions, a
numeric vector.
The column identifier for the predicted results (that is also numeric). As with
truth this can be specified different ways but the primary method is to use an
unquoted variable name. For _vec() functions, a numeric vector.
A logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the
computation proceeds.
Details
In the field of spectroscopy in particular, the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) has been used
as the standard way to report the quality of a model. It is the ratio between the standard deviation
of a variable and the standard error of prediction of that variable by a given model. However, its
systematic use has been criticized by several authors, since using the standard deviation to represent
the spread of a variable can be misleading on skewed dataset. The ratio of performance to inter-
quartile has been introduced by Bellon-Maurel et al. (2010) to address some of these issues, and
generalise the RPD to non-normally distributed variables.
Value
A tibble with columns .metric, .estimator, and .estimate and 1 row of values.
For grouped data frames, the number of rows returned will be the same as the number of groups.
For rpd_vec(), a single numeric value (or NA).rpiq
75


#### Examples
```{r}
# Supply truth and predictions as bare column names
rpd(solubility_test, solubility, prediction)
library(dplyr)
set.seed(1234)
size <- 100
times <- 10
# create 10 resamples
solubility_resampled <- bind_rows(
replicate(
n = times,
expr = sample_n(solubility_test, size, replace = TRUE),
simplify = FALSE
),
.id = "resample"
)
# Compute the metric by group
metric_results <- solubility_resampled %>%
group_by(resample) %>%
rpd(solubility, prediction)
metric_results
# Resampled mean estimate
metric_results %>%
summarise(avg_estimate = mean(.estimate))76
```
